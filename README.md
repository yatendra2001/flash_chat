# Flash Chat ⚡️

I've build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
The objective of this app is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into Flutter apps. I've used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.
